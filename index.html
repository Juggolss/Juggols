      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <img src="balay ni riz.jpg" alt="Calamba, Laguna birthplace of Rizal">
      <p>José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda was born on <strong>June 19, 1861</strong> in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines. He was the seventh of eleven children of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. His family was relatively well-off, which allowed him access to good education and opportunities.</p>
      <p>From a young age, Rizal showed great intelligence, creativity, and discipline. His mother was his first teacher and taught him prayers, reading, and moral values. At age 3, Rizal learned to read, and by age 8, he had written his first poem, <em>"Sa Aking Mga Kabata"</em>, which emphasized the importance of loving one’s language.</p>

      <img src="rizal.jpg" alt="Ateneo de Manila">
      <p>Rizal’s early schooling began under private tutors, then continued at Biñan, Laguna. In 1872, he enrolled at <strong>Ateneo Municipal de Manila</strong>, where he excelled and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with highest honors in 1877. He also pursued further studies in agriculture at the <strong>University of Santo Tomas</strong>.</p>
      <p>However, discrimination against Filipino students pushed him to continue his education abroad. In 1882, Rizal sailed to Spain and enrolled at the <strong>Universidad Central de Madrid</strong>, earning a Licentiate in Medicine in 1884 and a Licentiate in Philosophy and Letters in 1885. He specialized in ophthalmology to treat his mother’s failing eyesight.</p>
      <p>He further trained in Paris and Heidelberg, Germany, becoming a skilled eye doctor. While in Europe, Rizal also mastered multiple languages, including Spanish, French, German, and English.</p>
